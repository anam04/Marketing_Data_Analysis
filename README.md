## üîç Project Overview
This project explores how different models perform in understanding and predicting customer behavior in a marketing dataset. We applied clustering, regression, and classification methods to gain insights into customer spending patterns and loyalty program participation.

Key components:
- **Clustering (K-Means):** Segmented customers into 5 clusters using the elbow method; standardized variables ensured uniform analysis.  
- **ANOVA & Normality Testing:** Validated assumptions for regression; confirmed normal distribution through ANOVA and Q-Q plots.  
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Modeled spending score with predictors Age, Income, and Online Shopping Frequency; explained 94.8% of variance.  
- **KNN:** Determined optimal `k=11`; analyzed accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores at cluster level.  
- **Naive Bayes:** Compared cluster-wise accuracy and recall; highlighted challenges with false negatives.  
- **CART (Decision Trees):** Derived interpretable decision rules; Income and Spending Score emerged as strongest loyalty predictors.  
- **Logistic Regression:** Modeled probability of loyalty program participation; moderate predictive accuracy (45‚Äì55%).

üìä Key Findings

**Spending Score Predictors:**
* Online Shopping Frequency (+0.914 SD) and Income (+0.3429 SD) had the strongest positive effect on spending score.
* Age was statistically insignificant.

**Model Performance:**
* Regression: R¬≤ = 0.948 ‚Üí strong explanatory power.
* KNN: Optimal k=11, but accuracy ~50%.
* Naive Bayes: Accuracy peaked at ~54%, but recall varied across clusters.
* CART: Cluster 0 performed best (53% accuracy), with clear decision rules based on Income & Spending Score.
* Logistic Regression: Accuracies between 45‚Äì55%, F1 scores between 0.37‚Äì0.55.

**Recommendations:**

* Retain high-income, frequent shoppers with exclusive loyalty offers.
* Promote cost-saving campaigns for low-income/infrequent shoppers.
* Use CART decision rules for real-time, personalized marketing strategies.
